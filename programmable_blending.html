  <h3>Exploting Tile Memory to Implement Programmable Blending</h3>
  <p>
    Because the tile memory is on-chip and easily accessible, reads are much faster than they would be from video
    memory. Some vendors expose the capability to read the color value of the current framebuffer. This is called
    <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch.txt">framebuffer fetch</a>
    on GLES
    drivers. With access to the framebuffer value, arbitrary blend equations (beyond the available fixed set Porter-Duff
    blends) can be implemented, such as the "Photoshop" blend modes like "color burn" or "color dodge."
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    #extension GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch: require<br>
    <br>
    in vec4 v_color;<br>
    <br>
    out vec4 frag_color;<br>
    <br>
    void main() {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;frag_color = Blend(v_color, gl_LastFragData);<br>
    }<br>
  </p>

  <p>The alternative to framebuffer fetch requires multiple render passes: first everything before the blend must be
    rendered to an offscreen, then fed through the blend shader and rendered to the onscreen framebuffer. This requires
    a substantial amount of video memory throughput as the entire framebuffer has to be round tripped through video
    memory.</p>

  <aside>Note: While blending using fixed equations may be implemented as a read from video memory, it doesn't necessarily
    imply that the fragment processor is reading from video memory.</aside>
