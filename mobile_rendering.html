  <h1 class="title">Tile-Based Deferred Renderers (TBDR) Pt 1</h1>

  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>Mobile GPUs work differently from traditional discrete GPUs. For a fun overview, ARM has a manga guide to their
    mobile GPUs, <a href="https://interactive.arm.com/story/the-arm-manga-guide-to-the-mali-gpu/page/1">The Arm Manga
      Guide to the Mali GPU</a>. Mobile GPUs rasterize binned geometry in discrete sections of the framebuffer (called
    "tiles") independently, rather than process primitives across the entire framebuffer. These tiles might be
    as small as 8x8 or 16x16 pixels. In Psuedocode, the difference between mobile GPUs and destop GPUs comes down to</p>

  <b>Desktop</b>
  <p class="code">
    for (var triangle in triangles):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;for (var fragment in triangle):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rasterize(fragment)<br>
  </p>

  <b>Mobile</b>
  <p class="code">
    for (var tile in tiles):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;for (var triangle in triangles where triangle in tile):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (var fragment in triangle):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rasterize(fragment)<br>
  </p>

  <p>While the mobile approach seems more complicated, it allows for more efficient memory access patterns. In the
    desktop approach, a triangle that coverages a large % of the framebuffer will require writes across large regions of the backing
    memory. By binning the geometry by tile, the GPU enforces a localization of writes.

    A second important difference: in the desktop case, the writes and reads happen from video memory. Mobile GPUs add
    an additional on-chip cache that
    is only loaded and flushed once during processing of the tile. This further improves efficiency due to the locality
    of this cache. Expanding on the psuedocode from above, we can add the required load and store between tile and video memory.
  </p>

  <p class="code">
    for (var tile in tiles):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;var tile_memory = load(video_memory, load_action):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;for (var triangle in triangles where triangle in tile):<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rasterize(fragment, tile_memory)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;store(video_memory, tile_memory, store_action)<br>
  </p>

  <p>Much of the performance work for mobile focuses on exploiting the usage of the tile memory. For example,
    Multisample Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) is an anti-aliasing technique where N coverage samples are stored per pixel. At the
    end of a render pass, the N coverage samples per pixels are "resolved" (averaged) into a single sample. On a
    traditional desktop GPU 4x MSAA requires allocating textures that are 4x the size of a non-MSAA texture. on a mobile
    tile-based
    deferred renderer (TBDR), the 4x samples are only stored in tile memory and are resolved during the flush to video
    memory. As a result, 4x MSAA is "free" (from a memory perspective) on TBDR architectures.
  </p>

  <h3>Exploting Tile Memory to Implement Programmable Blending</h3>
  <p>
    Because the tile memory is on-chip and easily accessible, reads are much faster than they would be from video
    memory. Some vendors expose the capability to read the color value of the current framebuffer. This is called
    <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL/extensions/EXT/EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch.txt">framebuffer fetch</a>
    on GLES
    drivers. With access to the framebuffer value, arbitrary blend equations (beyond the available fixed set Porter-Duff
    blends) can be implemented, such as the "Photoshop" blend modes like "color burn" or "color dodge."
  </p>
  <p class="code">
    #extension GL_EXT_shader_framebuffer_fetch: require<br>
    <br>
    in vec4 v_color;<br>
    <br>
    out vec4 frag_color;<br>
    <br>
    void main() {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;frag_color = Blend(v_color, gl_LastFragData);<br>
    }<br>
  </p>

  <p>The alternative to framebuffer fetch requires multiple render passes: first everything before the blend must be
    rendered to an offscreen, then fed through the blend shader and rendered to the onscreen framebuffer. This requires
    a substantial amount of video memory throughput as the entire framebuffer has to be round tripped through video
    memory.</p>

  <aside>Note: While blending using fixed equations may be implemented as a read from video memory, it doesn't necessarily
    imply that the fragment processor is reading from video memory.</aside>
